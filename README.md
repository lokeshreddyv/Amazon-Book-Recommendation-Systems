# **INTRODUCTION**:       

Over the years e- commerce has taken over the world and Amazon is one of the most popular e-commerce companies, has its presence across the globe. We can find any product in amazon. And people love buying products in online. Because it has many advantages like we shop from anywhere in the world and we can find number of images related to a product and reviews by which we can decide to buy it or not. And “BOOKS” are one of such products that are high on sales. Many people buy books in online. After reading a book many people fall in love with such kind of books that they want to buy similar book. So in this mini project we developed a recommendation system based on content called Content based recommender system.
